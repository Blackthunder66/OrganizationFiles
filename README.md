# OrganizationFiles

This repository provides some advice and guidelines for researchers and professors working in applied mathematics, statistics or machine learning. The primal objective is to provide such information for people in my lab, but others might benefit from the resources as well.
You will find a focus on: writing scientific documents (Tex / LaTeX / BibTeX), coding (with Python) and sketching figures with Inkscape.
Feel free to fork the repository (by clicking **Fork** in the top-right corner of the page) and submit pull-request to improve it.


## [TeX / LaTeX / BibTeX](tex/)
In the [LaTeX section](tex/) is provided:

- Large harmonized reference file for my group : [references_all.bib](tex/biblio/references_all.bib)

- Snippets used for LaTeXing with Sublime text (XXX TODO: to be described for VSCode too!).

- LaTeX / TeX templates and examples:

|[article.tex](tex/draft-article/article.tex)|[beamer_js.tex](tex/draft-beamer/beamer_js.tex) | [beamer_tl.tex](tex/draft-beamer/beamer_tl.tex) | [exam.tex](tex/draft-exam/exam.tex)| [scribe.tex](tex/draft-scribe/scribe.tex) |

## [Python](python/draft-package/)
In section [draft-package](python/draft-package/)
an example of a Python package
 to start a new project.
If you are looking for more help on (scientific) Python I can only recommend my course with [B. Charlier](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~charlier), see: https://github.com/bcharlier/HMMA238


## [Images and Inkscape](inkscape/)
In the [Images and Inkscape](inkscape/) section, I am giving some insights on using images in science and communications, and discuss why **Inkscape** is an incredible tool to master for a PhD student or a modern researcher.


## Web/html
You can create your personal website seamlessly by following the instructions [here](https://wowchemy.com/templates/).


## [Advice (mostly) for PhD students](guidelines/)
In section [guidelines](guidelines/), standard information and work practices for working in my the group is provided. Information on summer schools, fundings tips for traveling, etc. is also given.

## Calendar / polls / etc. 

To create polls with unique possibilities (say you want the people you contact to choose one single choice, on a first-come, first-served basis) evento is a good solution evento.renater.fr/ , see help here : https://numerique76.spip.ac-rouen.fr/IMG/pdf/planifier_des_rendez-vous_evento_modifie_erun_76.pdf .

Use a calendar, a paper or an online version is up to you.
