# Quarto

## Content

Inspired by the great blog by [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://emilhvitfeldt.com/blog),
I have started using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for my presentations.
Also a good design for a website with quarto is given by  on [Marvin Schmitt's](https://www.marvinschmitt.com/).

In the Quarto section is provided:

- a Quarto template for presentation: [presentation-template](presentation-template/)

- a Quarto example for a website : [HAX712X](https://josephsalmon.github.io/HAX712X/) with source code available [here](https://github.com/josephsalmon/HAX712X/blob/main/index.qmd).
